## Release 1.0.0 (2025-01-15)

This is the initial release of the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint.







<!-- REQUIRED: Add any new know issues in this release -->
<!-- REQUIRED: Remove any know issues fixed in this release -->
## All Known Issues

The following are the known issues for the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint:

- Optional features reflection and image captioning are not available in Helm-based deployment.
- Currently, Helm-based deployment is not supported for [NeMo Guardrails](nemo-guardrails.md).
- The Blueprint responses can have significant latency when using [NVIDIA API Catalog cloud hosted models](deploy-docker-nvidia-hosted.md).
- The accuracy of the pipeline is optimized for certain file types like `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`. The accuracy may be poor for other file types supported by NV-Ingest, since image captioning is disabled by default.
- When updating model configurations in Kubernetes `values.yaml` (for example, changing from 70B to 8B models), the RAG UI automatically detects and displays the new model configuration from the backend. No container rebuilds are required - simply redeploy the Helm chart with updated values and refresh the UI to see the new model settings in the Settings panel.
- The NeMo LLM microservice can take 5-6 minutes to start for every deployment.
- B200 GPUs are not supported for the following advanced features. For these features, use H100 or A100 GPUs instead.
  - Image captioning support for ingested documents
  - NeMo Guardrails for guardrails at input/output
  - VLM-based inferencing in RAG
  - PDF extraction with Nemoretriever Parse
- Sometimes when HTTP cloud NIM endpoints are used from `deploy/compose/.env`, the `nv-ingest-ms-runtime` still logs gRPC environment variables. Following log entries can be ignored.
- For MIG support, currently the ingestion profile has been scaled down while deploying the chart with MIG slicing This affects the ingestion performance during bulk ingestion, specifically large bulk ingestion jobs might fail.
- Individual file uploads are limited to a maximum size of 400 MB during ingestion. Files exceeding this limit are rejected and must be split into smaller segments before ingesting.
- `llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5` model provides more verbose responses in non-reasoning mode compared to v1.0. For some queries the LLM model may respond with information not available in given context. Also for out of domain queries the model may provide responses based on it's own knowledge. Developers are strongly advised to [tune the prompt](prompt-customization.md) for their use cases to avoid these scenarios.
- The auto selected NIM-LLM profile for llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5 may not work for some GPUs. Follow steps outlined in the appropriate [deployment guide](model-profiles.md) to select an optimized profile using `NIM_MODEL_PROFILE` before deploying.
- Slow VDB upload is observed in Helm deployments for Elasticsearch.
